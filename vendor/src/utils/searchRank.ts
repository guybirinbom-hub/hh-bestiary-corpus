/**
 * bug 2026-09-13: search-rank — ONE ranking rule for every search box in the app.
 *
 * Owner (2026-09-13, Add items, searching "waterskin"): *"when i search for a waterskin it is all the
 * way down instead of the first option … that means that water skin needs to be the first thing that
 * appears"*. MEASURED: 19 rows matched, ordered by level-then-name, with Waterskin 16th — behind
 * Adventurer's Pack and 14 class kits whose DESCRIPTION lists a waterskin. Every box in the app
 * filters correctly and none of them ORDER; this module is the missing half.
 *
 * The rule, best first (lower number = better match):
 *
 *   0  the name IS the query
 *   1  the name starts with the query
 *   2  the query appears in the name as a whole word
 *   3  the query appears anywhere in the name
 *   4  multi-word query: every token appears in the name
 *   5  the query appears in another field (traits, description, a kit's contents)
 *   6  multi-word query: every token appears in the name or another field
 *   NO_MATCH  nothing matched
 *
 * Ties keep the caller's EXISTING order — alphabetical, by level, the player's own inventory order.
 * `rankBySearch` sorts on (tier, original index), so ranking only ever lifts the better matches and
 * never reshuffles equals; a box with no query is returned untouched, the same array it passed in.
 *
 * Comparison is case-, diacritic- and whitespace-insensitive, and reads a curly apostrophe as a
 * straight one (the content carries both).
 *
 * A record that does not match at all sorts LAST rather than being dropped: every caller has already
 * applied its own filter, and this must not second-guess it (FeatsTab also matches rarity, the tracker
 * matches creature stats). Ranking is presentation; filtering stays the caller's.
 */

 * out, so on a broad query ("a") it is never built at all.

/**
 * Does a record survive the box's own FILTER? The other half of the same rule.
 *
 * adversarially confirmed 2026-09-13: ranking alone left the owner's literal query broken. He wrote
 * *"i searched for water skin"*, and `water skin` typed into Add items matched NOTHING — 0 rows —
 * because every box filters with a plain substring `includes`, which "Waterskin" fails on the space.
 * Ranking cannot lift a row the filter already threw away.
 *
 * A single-word query is exactly `includes`, byte for byte, so nothing about the boxes' existing
 * behaviour moves. A multi-word one also matches when EVERY token is somewhere in the text — the same
 * condition `searchTier` scores as tier 4/6, so the filter can no longer drop a row the ranking was
 * built to rank.
 *
 * `other` is everything the box searches BESIDES the name, the same string the caller hands
 * `rankBySearch` as its `otherOf` — so a box's filter and its ranking read exactly the same fields.
 * With a single-word query `searchMatches(q, name, other)` is `name.includes(q) || other.includes(q)`,
 * i.e. the OR of includes every box already wrote.
 */

/**
 * Order an already-filtered list by match quality, best first, ties in the order they arrived.
 *
 * Returns the SAME array reference when there is nothing to rank, so a caller can keep it in a memo
 * without forcing a re-render on every keystroke that clears the box.
